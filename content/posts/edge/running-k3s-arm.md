## Introduction

K3S is an light weight certified Kubernetes distribution, specifically designed for `IoT` and `Edge computing`

### Architecture

K3S can be deployed on `x86_64`, `ARMv7`, and `ARM64` architectures.

K3S has 2 main components `Server` and `Agent`

### Setting up Environment

To Run K3S you can use vm managers like `multipass` or `Virtualbox`

In this example we will be using `Vagrant` and `Virtualbox` and the Operating system is Ubuntu.

#### Install Virtualbox

```bash
brew install --cask virtualbox
```

#### Install Vagrant on Mac

```bash
brew install --cask vagrant
```

```bash
vagrant version
Installed Version: 2.4.3
Latest Version: 2.4.3

You're running an up-to-date version of Vagrant!
```

Create an Folder and run `vagrant init` command

```bash
mkdir vms
cd vms

vagrant init bento/ubuntu-24.04 --box-version 202502.21.0
```

This will create an Vagrant File. if you wan to access the K3S from outside of vm you can update the configs by port-forwarding or using private_network

```sh
config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 8080, host: 8080, host_ip: "127.0.0.1"
```

or

```bash
config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10"
```

in Above case we will be using `private_network`, IP that you are going to use should not be conflict with existing network configurations.

```rb
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "bento/ubuntu-24.04"
  config.vm.box_version = "202502.21.0"
  config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.40"
end
```

run `vagrant up` to start the vm in virtualbox.

once the vm is up and running you can ssh into the vm using

```bash
vagrant ssh

sudo bash
```

### Installing and Configuring K3S

K3s Supports Multiple Datastores.

1. Embedded SQLite
2. Embedded etcd
3. External Database

Here we will be using `Embedded SQLite`. `Embedded SQLite` has [limitations](https://docs.k3s.io/datastore).

for HA, use `etcd` or `External Datastore`

To install K3S on vm

```bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -

```

To check the real-time logs of the K3S service and ensure it is running correctly, use:

```bash
journalctl -u k3s -f
```

Once K3S is installed, verify the cluster status by listing the nodes:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
NAME      STATUS   ROLES                  AGE   VERSION
master3   Ready    control-plane,master   36s   v1.32.3+k3s1
```

By default, the installation includes:

- **Flannel** as the Container Network Interface (CNI)
- **Traefik** as the ingress controller
- **Klipper Load Balancer** as the service load balancer

```bash
kubectl get pods -A
NAMESPACE     NAME                                      READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE

```

### Troubleshooting

- If the `kubectl get nodes` command does not show the node as `Ready`, check the K3S logs:

```bash
journalctl -u k3s -f
```
